Required:

1) script tag to reference angular.js version
2) ng-app directive in order to recognize and bootstrap as angular application.

Good practices with js:

Create abstractions between functions.
Do not create global variables. Use what is called IIFE(Immediately invoked function expression). Function that is invoked by itself. (Only that is present in entire file Eg: script.js) -> IIFE.zip contains example.

Controller directive is present in HTML. ng-controller can be used where ng-app is already present and need to have a name.
Controller is a function that Angular invokes. Controller takes a $scope parameter.

Primary responsibility of controller is to set up model for $scope object. Angular passes $scope to controller function and controller manipulates that scope.
Controller does not change HTML. It changes model and uses binding expression to manipulate data in view.

Angular http call will automatically convert json to js objects. http get call does not provide data right away and gives it in future but gives a 'promise' object immediately. So use this promise in Angular model to get data later to view.

In ideal world, controllers are not written in global namespace. They are written inside module.

Working with modules:
Create a module with a name. Add dependencies in array required for this new module.
Register controller with module.
Tell angular to use module with ng-app directive.

Directives:
ng-click = search() -> triggers function from js file based on click event.
ng-submit = search() -> triggers function from js file based on button.
ng-repeat = "repo in repos" -> similar to for each loop.

can call http methods inside another http declared method and obtained reponse from first call can be used.

Filter:
expression|filtername:parameter

Services:
Powerful. Can keep the code that does not fall under view or controller.
Directives act as intermediate between model and view.
$interval, $http are services.

AngularJs is JS framework that binds HTML UI to JS objects. It is a binding framework.
