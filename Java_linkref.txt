list of difference between StringBuffer, String, and StringBuilder in Java :

1) The String object is immutable in Java but StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable objects.

2) StringBuffer is synchronized while StringBuilder is not which makes StringBuilder faster than StringBuffer.

3) Concatenation operator "+" is internally implemented using either StringBuffer or StringBuilder.

4) Use String if you require immutability, use StringBuffer in java if you need mutable + thread-safety and use StringBuilder in Java if you require mutable + without thread-safety.

java.util.regex consists of three classes. Pattern class, Matcher class and PatternSyntaxException class.

OOPs concepts - very serious

Thread can be created by: implementing Runnable interface, extending the Thread class.

"this" is used with variables or methods and used to call constructer of same class.

Holding the reference of the other class within some other class is known as composition.

Generics provide compile-time type safety that allows programmers to catch invalid types at compile time. Java Generic methods and generic classes enable programmers to specify, with a single method declaration, a set of related methods or, with a single class declaration, a set of related types.

Externalizable is an interface which contains two methods readExternal and writeExternal. These methods give you a control over the serialization mechanism.

The size is the number of elements actually stored in the vector, while capacity is the maximum number of elements it can store at a given instance of time.

An enumeration is an interface containing methods for accessing the underlying data structure from which the enumeration is obtained. It allows sequential access to all the elements stored in the collection.

An object's lock is a mechanism that is used by multiple threads to obtain synchronized access to the object. A thread may execute a synchronized method of an object only after it has acquired the object's lock.

Overridden methods must have the same name, argument list, and return type. The overriding method may not limit the access of the method it overrides.
